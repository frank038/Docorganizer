# Docorganizer
A simple document manager.

Free to use and modify.

This program is a kind of todo program for files. Just drop the file you want to remember for some job onto this program.
This program doesn't modify the real files in any way. The user can only manage the files in the folder collections, in which are stored all the data.

Features:
- bidirectional drag and drop support;
- date (in the form yyyymmdd) above the file name; the items in the main program are sorted by data;
- comments;
- menu (using the right mouse button) for some operations: Open/View the file, Delete, Modify, Open the parent folder, File data;
- double click on the item to open/view it with the default program.
